# ESP32-CAM Parking Detection System - Required Libraries

## Core ESP32 Libraries (Built-in with ESP32 Arduino Core)
- Arduino.h
- WiFi.h
- esp_now.h
- esp_wifi.h
- esp_camera.h
- esp_sleep.h

## Edge Impulse Libraries
- parkingpal5478069-project-1_inferencing.h
  * This is your custom Edge Impulse model library
  * Generated from your trained parking detection model
  * Must be installed in Arduino/libraries/ folder

- edge-impulse-sdk (dependency of above)
  * Automatically included with Edge Impulse model
  * Provides DSP and inference functions

## Installation Instructions

### 1. ESP32 Arduino Core
Install via Arduino IDE Board Manager:
- File → Preferences → Additional Board Manager URLs
- Add: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
- Tools → Board → Boards Manager → Search "ESP32" → Install

### 2. Edge Impulse Model Library
1. Export your trained model from Edge Impulse Studio
2. Select "Arduino library" as deployment target
3. Download the zip file
4. Extract to Arduino/libraries/ folder
5. Restart Arduino IDE

### 3. Hardware Requirements
- ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker module)
- MicroSD card (optional, for data logging)
- External antenna (recommended for better RF range)

### 4. Board Settings in Arduino IDE
- Board: "AI Thinker ESP32-CAM"
- Upload Speed: "115200"
- Flash Frequency: "80MHz"
- Flash Mode: "QIO"
- Partition Scheme: "Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)"
- Core Debug Level: "None"

### 5. Upload Method
- Connect GPIO0 to GND before power-on for programming mode
- Use FTDI adapter (3.3V) for serial communication
- Remove GPIO0-GND connection after upload for normal operation
